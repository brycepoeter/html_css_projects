<p>The reasons for planting native plants are numerous, but they usually fall into one of a few categories.
</p>
</div.b>

<h3>It helps your local ecosystem</h3> 
<p>Everything is co-dependent in an established ecosystem. Native species of plants and animals evolve within the context of one another. They come to depend 
    upon one another for food, shelter, nutrients, or any number of things and cannot survive without the other. A classic example of this is the monarch butterfly. 
    Adult monarchs drink the nectar of a wide range of flowers, but monarch caterpillars can eat only milkweed. Without milkweed, monarchs would cease to exist. 
    While not every organism has its fate tied so directly to another species, the plants and animals that live around us depend upon the equilibrium that shaped 
    their features. Yaupon holly berries are eaten by mockingbirds, waxwings, and robins. Their flowers are a source of nectar for bees. Planting native hibiscus 
    can bring hummingbirds. Not only is this a joy to watch but it also brings about a healthier ecosystem. 
</p>

<h3>It's less risky than planting a non-native species</h3>
<p>When you go to plant your garden, the last thing you want to do is harm the world around you. The fact that you're planting a garden or backyard shows that you 
    care about the natural life around you. When a new species is introduced to a region, there is always a risk that it disrupts the local ecosystem. This does not 
    mean that you have to plant exclusively native plants though. There are many non-native plants that have been proven to grow well in our environment without choking 
    our native species. Crepe myrtles are one such example. Others, like the Chinese tallow, grow so beautifully they choke out native life. Before you plant, see if your
    plant is native, non-native, or invasive. If it's invasive, planting it puts our environment at risk. 
</p>

<h3>It's good for your wallet</h3>
<p>It's true. When landscaping, native plants are more readily available than non-native plants. Distributors have the advantage of growing native 
    plants in the most advantageous place in the world to do so: their native range. Modern plants are the results of millions of years of adaptation 
    to a specific range and set of conditions. As such, they require less additional water and fertilizer than other options, which makes them easier 
    and less expensive to maintain. This pushes the price from growers down, which means not only do you save on maintenance but you often save on purchase price 
    as well. 
    Plants from our area tend to like the humidity, the amount of rain they get, the hot summers and mild winters, 
    and the plethora of other characteristics of life on the coastal plain. 
    Another reason is people tend to associate an area with a certain style of landscaping and tend to follow it. Whether you buy your plants 
    from a nursery or hire an outside contractor, chances are the native plants they offer will be more economical than the exotics.  
</p>
<h3>It takes less effort to maintain</h3>
<p>
    This is perhaps the biggest advantage for the hobbyist gardener who isn't looking to spend every weekend working in the sun. Native plants 
    are lower-maintenance than non-native plants. Native plants are built to withstand our climate, our hot summers and temperate winters, 
    the amount of rain we get, and even our occasional hurricane. Imagine how many hurricanes the century oaks at Hermann Park have withstood. 
    It's not by accident that native plants do very well in their native environments. Native landscapes are as close to set-and-forget as gardening can get, 
    saving you both time and resources.
