<p>The reasons for planting native plants are numerous, but they usually fall into one of a few categories.
</p>
</div.b>

<h3>It's good for the environment</h3> 
<p>Not only are native plants already adapted to your environment, but your environment is already adapted to them too. 
Animals like birds and bees are already used to eating their fruits and nectar, and other plants in the area have evolved to
coexist with the native plants in your garden. You know 100% for sure that planting an oak tree in your backyard in Houston won't 
disrupt your local environment because your local environment has evolved to depend on oaks being present. With exotic or non-native 
trees, there is always a risk that your local ecosystem will be negatively affected. In addition to being a great defense against invasive 
species, planting natives actively supports your ecosystem! Planting native milkweed, for instance, encourages monarch butterflies to  
reproduce in your area, increasing the population of one of our area's most delightful creatures.
</p>

<h3>It's good for your wallet</h3>
<p>It's true. Native plants are more readily available than non-native plants. Part of this is that they are easy to grow and plentiful. 
    Another reason is people tend to associate an area with a certain style of landscaping and tend to follow it. Whether you buy your plants 
    from a nursery or hire an outside contractor, chances are the native plants they offer will be more economical than the exotics.  
</p>
<h3>It takes less effort to maintain</h3>
<p>
    This is perhaps the biggest advantage for the hobbyist gardener who isn't looking to spend every weekend working in the sun. Native plants 
    are lower-maintenance than non-native plants. It makes sense. Native plants have developed here over millions of years. They are built to 
    withstand our climate, our hot summers and temperate winters, and even our occasional hurricanes. Think of how many hurricanes the century 
    oaks by Hermann Park have withstood. It's not by accident that native plants do very well in their native environments. This means you won't have 
    to water them as much, since they're used to how much rain Houston gets, and it also means these plants will have lower fertilizer and mulch demands. 
    All in all, native landscapes are as close to set-and-forget as gardening can get, saving you both time and resources.
